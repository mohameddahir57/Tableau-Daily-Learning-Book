# Day 8: Discrete vs Continuous Data

**Date:** February 8, 2026

## 1. Discrete (Blue Fields)
Values that are distinct and separate (e.g., Categories, Names). Adding a discrete field to a shelf creates headers.

## 2. Continuous (Green Fields)
Values that form an unbroken whole (e.g., Time series, Measures like profit). Adding a continuous field to a shelf creates an axis.

## 3. The Color Coding
Understanding why fields are blue or green.

## Summary
Discrete and continuous fields determine how Tableau draws the visualization—either as headers or axes.
